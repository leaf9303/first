    <h1>Short on Change</h1>
      <p>Jiyoon Han’s family owns Bean & Bean Coffee Roasters, a chain of coffee shops in New York and New Jersey. Some of them were closed for months because of the coronavirus pandemic. When the shops reopened, employees had a problem: They kept running out of coins. “Getting change was just not possible for weeks,” Han told TIME for Kids.</p>
      <p>Bean & Bean isn’t the only business facing this issue. Supermarket chains have put up signs asking customers to pay electronically or provide exact change. Until recently, banks were unable to order their usual supply of coins from the government. What’s going on?</p>
