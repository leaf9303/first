    <h1>Money Problems</h1>
    <p style="margin-top:45px;"><img src="Coin.jpg" width="450"><br><br><strong>The <u>U.S.</u></strong> has been experiencing a coin shortage.
      Health restrictions brought on by the pandemic meant that in spring 2020, fewer coins were being made at the U.S. Mint. In June, the government temporarily limited the distribution of coins to banks.</p>
    <p style="margin-top:45px;">Karen Dynan is a professor of economics at Harvard University, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She’s also a former economist for the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Dynan says there’s another, even bigger reason for the shortage: People aren’t going out and spending as much. “Coins have not disappeared,” she says. “They’re in people’s homes.”</p>
    <p style="margin-top:45px;">In July, a U.S. Coin Task Force was created to address the shortage. Now the situation is beginning to improve. The government made a promising announcement on January 13: Banks will no longer be limited as to how many coins they can order. The coin shortage may soon be a thing of the past.</p>
