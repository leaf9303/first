    <h1>Do Coins Matter?</h1>
      <p>The pandemic has caused many people to make fewer purchases using cash. Electronic payment has become more common. “We were already moving toward a cashless economy,” Dynan says. “The virus has just accelerated all of that.”</p>
      <p>Tae Kang is the owner of New Look Hand Car Wash, in Rochelle Park, New Jersey. He has seen this change in customer spending firsthand. “We’ve noticed more people paying electronically,” he says.</p>
      <p>With electronic payments on the rise, do we still need coins? For now, the answer is yes. If you want to help end the shortage, Dynan suggests making “a special trip” to exchange your coins for bills at a bank or to spend them at a store.</p>
